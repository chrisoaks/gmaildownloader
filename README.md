# gmaildownloader

This is a simple OAuth script that runs in the background and automatically downloads your gmail attachments to your computer as soon as someone sends them to you.  I built it for a friend who recieves a lot of email attachments throughout the day and manually downloading each one actually consumes a significant amount of time.  It's annoying, anyway.  This script eliminates that effort and the attachments will show up in a folder of your choosing.
